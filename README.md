This application features a chatbot built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. It is powered by a fine-tuned **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** model and is developed with **React** for the frontend interface. The chatbot offers conversational capabilities designed to improve user interaction by retrieving and generating contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Integrates Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, a fine-tuned large language model, ensuring high-quality interactions.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances response accuracy by fetching relevant information from knowledge bases before generating answers.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using React, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for various domains such as education, customer service, or technical support.

## How It Works

1. **Input Query**: Users interact with the chatbot via a text-based interface.
2. **Retrieval Phase**: Relevant data is retrieved from predefined knowledge sources using RAG.
3. **Response Generation**: The fine-tuned model generates responses based on the retrieved context.
4. **User Feedback**: The system adapts over time by incorporating user feedback to improve performance.
